This is a Rock Paper scissor Game .

Initially there are 3 weapons ie Rock Paper Scissor . We can even add Additional weapons like Lizard and Spock.
You need to select the game mode ie Basic or Advanced(extra weapons) . 
This Game can also we extended if the Requirement comes in future . So if let's say we have a requirement of adding more and more weapons ,  we can do that also ,but for that we need to define the strategy like which weapon can destroy the other weapon . 

I have also added an option where you can see both players as computers . Computer 1 and Computer 2 play . It will show you the results that which computer has won the game. 


I have also added various tests to unit test the individual functionality and also the coverage.


This is Working Fine with :
npm: '8.19.2',
node: '18.11.0'

## Dependencies    
install the npm using 
```sh
npm install
```

## RUN
to start the game :
```sh
npm start
```

## TEST
```sh
npm test
```

## COVERAGE
```sh
npm run test-cov
```
